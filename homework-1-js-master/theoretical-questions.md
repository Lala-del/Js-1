1.Question & 2.Question: Var is a globally/functional scope.It's globally when we use it outside of function, it's functional when we use it inside of the function.But in case of globally, if we call var which is inside of the function it will give us is not defined . This means that it can be accessed only within that function.This is bad tone of var.
    But let and const are block scoped .So they are  only available for use within that block.Secondly let cann't be redeclared ,if you want to change let ' s value it ' ll give you error that ' let .. already declared '.Const and let are similar,but we cann't change value or declare again it.it usually used for constant values,such as week days and etc.
